			<h2>How to order a custom picture frame online</h2>
			<p>We aim to keep this as simple, but as deep as possible. With our frame creator you can create a large variety of custom frames with millions of possible combinations. It helps having a guide to achieve what you want, we will aim to make this the most comprehensive online framing guide. The following guide will cover most cases of a custom picture frame and will explain the recommended options.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Enter your photo or artwork size, then click on Add a Frame:
					<ol type="a">
						<li>If your photo or artwork is a standard size, you can find it in our list above.
						</li>
						<li>Our system will build all your selections around your photo size. Please keep in mind that frames will overlap the entered size by about 4-6mm on all sides. Matboards will do the same by about 3-5mm. The 'Visible' size is an approximation of the area including this overlap, please note that if you require a particular visible size we must be notified. Also the overlap amount will vary based on sizes and selections.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Select a frame, you can always change this as you go.
					<ol type="a">
						<li>To view different sets of frames, select a colour set from the dropdown list.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>(Optional) Select a matboard:
					<ol type="a">
						<li>You can choose from a variety of colours to suit your frame and artwork.</li>
						<li>We offer double mats too.</li>
						<li>Be sure to select the thickness you would like the border to be.<br/> A (very) general rule is to match the frame width or keep it in ratio.<br/> The frame will overlap approximately 4mm on all sides of the border.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>(Optional) Select a backing:
					<ol type="a">
						<li>By default you will receive 3mm MDF.</li>
						<li>Foamcore is an acid free product that will protect your pictures from colour fading. It is also lighter than MDF.<br/> We recommend using foamcore for most works. Use non-adhesive for original artworks/certificates.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>(Optional) Select a glass type:
					<ol type="a">
						<li>The default glass type is 2mm Clear Glass.</li>
						<li>Non Reflective should be used in areas with lots of potential glare from natural or artificial light sources.
						</li>
						<li>UV Resistant Glass should be used for frames that will face direct sunlight.
						</li>
						<li>Perspex is highly recommended as it is durable, light and comes with 94% UV Resistance. It looks the same as clear glass and will not fade or become cloudy over time.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>What is the difference between a custom picture frame and a photo frame?</h3>
			<p>In short, not a whole lot! These two terms came about through industry trends and what they have meant has changed over time. Our definitions (that agrees with the more widely accepted meanings) are:</p>
			<p><b>Photo Frames: </b>Standard Size frames used to hold photographs or images. Generally these will stand on tables but commonly include the option of hanging. Matboards can be added to a photo frame optionally.</p>
			<p><strong>Picture Frames: </strong>Any size frame used to display photographs, images, artworks and other memorabilia. Picture frames usually contain matboards and alternative backings such as foamcore for conservation of artworks. Larger amounts of customisations such as depth can be made with a picture frame.</p>
			<p>The line between these terms is quite blurry, but we'll aim to keep it simple based on your needs. Many framers and companies have their own definitions, and some will interchange the terms freely, so it can be quite difficult to differentiate the two. The best way to find what you are after is to look at what you are framing, then make a decision from there. If it is small portraits of your family to go on your desk; cheaper photo frames will suffice. If you are framing an original artwork or large poster, a custom picture frame will likely suit and help achieve your goals. Regardless of your choice, we offer both at professionally made standards and are more than happy to help you choose the correct frame for anything you might want to put in there.

			<p>Glass can not be replaced as it won't make it on its own. Instead we can offer refund of glass price charged and you may obtain one locally or we can send a piece of clear acrylic (Perspex). The clear acrylic is durable and travels to any destination without the risk of breakage. Once it is in the frame there is no visible difference between the acrylic and clear glass. Our acrylic is of a very high quality and will not distort or become cloudy.</p>
